The Internet Technology
========================
The Link Layer
---------------
store and forward networking ====60s and 70s
hops are defined by geography trying to minimize cost
- innovation happend was packet network. network sharing
and how to deal with outages. speed....
 packet switching took 20+ years to perfect.
 how to move the message efficiently over the internet.
 . shared network infrastructure focuses only on packets
 the notion of hops and intermediate computers didn't go away.
 to solve the problems that can arise in a shared network, they
 came up with a layered model.
 
 the big problem is getting data reliable.
 if we break it into small pieces, we have a better solution
 
 TCP/IP model (4 layers) --- popular
 OSI model  (7 layers)
 
 - develop documents on these pieces
  how they work and interact with each other.
  IETF  www.ietf.org
  RFCs "request for comments"
  Layerd Architecture
  ====================
  Application, Transport, Internet, Link]
  
  The link Layer: only worries about moving the data
  from one hop to another (the connection from one computer
  to another computer) this could be one mile, a few feets
  a fibre optic a copper ....etc.
  
  problems solved by the Link Layer.
   how does gata get pushed onto a link
   How is th link shared
   [Etherenet, Wireless Ethernet]
   
   Each card (wirels has a serial number 
   6 2 digits number.  these numbers are good to get
   a connection from one hub to another.
   0f:21:64:12:63:1a
   
   the mac address of the sender and receiver is encoded in
   the packet.
   
   **then the router takes that packet and routes it on a different link layer.
Sharing Nicely -Avoiding chaos

. CSMA/CD carrier sense Media Access with collision detection
.to avoid garbled messages, systems must observr "rules" (protocols)
. Ethernet rules are simple

- listen
- wait for silence
- Begin Transmitting data
-  Listen for your own data
- If you can't hear your data clearly, assume a collison, stop and
  wait before trying again.
 - Each system waits a different amount of time to avoid "too


Robert Metcalf ; the person who invented Ethernet
at  Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center)
Inspired by an earlier wireless network called Aloha from the
university of hawii
 * Ethernet becomes shared when you plug it into a hub or
 switch...
======================================================
The Ethernet Story --- Bom Metcalfe - Univ of Austin Texas
A building full with computers and people. how to get them connected.

segnet project
bravo text editor
aloha net radio network (University of Hawaii) solved lots of problems.
randomize retransmission --how to share a cable. inspired by Aloha net.
ethernet cable...manchester encoding.
carrier sense...check to see if someone else is sending at the same time
each packet would carry two addresses; one for the source and one for
the destination 8 bits each...
 do redundancy check at the receiving end ...check-sum
 
 Tat Lam designed the passive electronic components
 David ladel
 
 fast ethernet 100Gb/second.. terabit ethernet is the future.
 =================================================
 Coax, ethernet wire built by Robert Metcalf was
 inspired by wireless
he founded 3com

====================================================
lots of engineers were working on the link layer problem
lots of engineers focused on the IP layer(Internet)
======================================
Link Layer
===============
Goal: Gets your data from this computer to the other computer half way across the world.
Each router knows about nearby routers
ip is bes effort - it is OK to drop data if things go bad.

IP Addresses:
============
Ip address Format is four numbers with dots -each number 1-255(32bits)
the address is broken into two parts

network:like area code

host

While the data is traversing the internet - all that matters is the network number
prefix is the first two numbers...
the last two numbers are meaningful inside the local network

Internetwork IP ( one network inside the big network)

Routers maintain Router Tables
  list of where t osend packets based on destination network address:
  bandwidth on adjacent links;
  traffic on adjacent links;
  state of neighbour.
  ==========================
  DHCP= Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
  
  Non-Routable Addresses
  . A typical home router does NAT
  ========================================
  Peering into the Internet
  =====================
  tracert
  . Each IP packet had a field called "Time to Live"- TTL
  The TTL is used to deal with loops in the network - normally if
  routers got confused and ended up with a loop - the network would clog
  up rapidly.##########TTL is a field that routers change
  everytime a packet goes through a router the number decreases
  if the TTL hits 0, then the router discards the packet################
  #########################################
  How Traceroute Works.
  . Normal packets are sent with a time to live (TTL) of 255 hops.
  . Trace route sends a packet with TTL=1, TTL=2,...
  . So each packet gets part-way  there and then gets dropped and
  traceroute gets a notification of where the drop happens.
  . This builds a map of the nodes that a packet visits when crossing the internet.
  ==========================================
  The perfect is the enemy of the good
  
  . IP DiesL best effort to get data across bunch of hops from one network to another network.
  . IP Does Not: Guarantee delivery.
