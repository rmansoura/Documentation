Data Transfer with Leased Lines
 cost was based on distance
 
 Store and Forward Networking 
    the sole imputes was to keep the cost to minimal
	
	Typically specialized in Mail, Email could make it across the country in 6 hours to about 2 days.
	You generally focused your life on one computer . Early 1980;s
	messages [data] were stored locally on disk before sending them
   ====================
  =BITNET typically specialized in Mail.

	DARPA NET Research Networks 1960-1980's
	. How can we avoid having a direct connection between all pairs of computers or long snake-like connections.
	. How can we dynamizally handle outages switching between multiple paths.
	. How t otransport many messages simultaneously and efficiently?
	* motivation for development is people and keeping them connected.
	
 The difference between BITNET and ARPA net was about packet switching
 
 Efficient Message Transmission: Packet Switching
  . Challenge: in a simple approach lie store and forward. lare messages block small ones.
  . Break each message into packets.
  . Can allow the packets from a single message to travel over different paths, dynamically.
  . router were introducted.
  ananlogy: if you want to send a large message using postcards.
   you put a piece of the meassage on each card and use a sequence number to label the piece of the messgae.
     Hello there. have a nice day
	 Hello ther(, csev. dfh)
	 e, have a (2. dalk)
	 nice day. (3, dfhlkfd0)
	 then put all cards in the mailbox for the mailman to come and pick them
	 these postcards can take different paths.

	 packets are about breaking a message into small pieces, labeling them
	 individually and throwing them at the network
	 packets get reassembled on the other end using the from, to and the sequence number

	Birthplace of the internet, 1969
	at 10:30 p.m. 29 October 1969, the first ARPANET message was sent from UCLA sit
	to Stanford Research Institute. Based on Packet switching and
	dynamic resource allocation, the sharing of information digitally
	from this first node of ARPANET launched the Internet revolusion.
