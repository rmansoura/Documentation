Linux Boot Process:
============
1) BIOS (Basic Input/Output System.) 
    performs some system integrity checks (POST-Power On Self Test)
	searchs, loads and executes the boot loader program and gives control to it.
2) MBR (Master Boot Record) is located in the first sector of the bootable disk.
    MBR is less than 512 bytes in size. this has three components
	 1) primary boot loader info - 446 bytes
	 2) partition table info - 64 bytes *16,16,16,16) 4 partitions
	 3) magic numbers - 2 bytes
    MBR loads and executes the GRUB boot loader

3) GRUB (Grand Unified BootLoader)
	it loads and executes kernel and inited images and give control to the kernel

4) KERNEL	once loaded into RAM it always resides on RAM until the machine is shutdown.
  it starts its operations by executing INIT process.
 
5) INIT (INITIALIZATION)
  . looks at the /etc/inittab file to decide the run level.
  
  .
 6) RUNLEVEL programs
 Run level0 - /ect/rc.d/rc0.d/
 Run level 1 - /ect/rc.d/rc1.d

 =====================================
 xz Compression
   xz, bzip2, gzip are new compression utilities
   xz has a better compression.
   
   xz -z filename
   
  
gzip file1  creates file1.gz  use gunzip file1.gz to decompress the file
for directories, use tar to archive a directory   tar -cvzf homedir.tar.gz home
